        <h1>Double All Day</h1>

        <p>Please join us in Portland on Saturday and Sunday, May 6-7 for the Oregon session of the 2023 Pacific Northwest Sacred Harp Double All Day! Registration opens at 9 am, where we will be checking proof of negative antigen test (see Covid policy below). We will sing from the 1991 Sacred Harp 9:30-3:00 both days, with dinner on the grounds at noon. Loaner books will be available.</p>

        <p>Saturday we will sing from the Denson, Sunday we will sing from Christian Harmony.</p>

        <h2 class="text-pretitle">Venue</h2>
        <p>The Laurelhurst Club, 3721 SE Ankeny St, Portland OR. The venue is fully accessible via a ramp from the sidewalk, and there is plenty of nearby on-street parking.</p>

        <h2 class="text-pretitle">Singing School</h2>
        <p>There will be a Singing School on Friday night (May 5) taught by Calum Woods from Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. The Singing School will be on Christian Harmony, so be sure to bring your blue book. We will gather at the Kennedy School Community Room (in the SE corner of the building) at 5736 NE 33rd Ave. Doors at 6:30, singing school from 7:00 to 8:30. Beverages and food are available at the Kennedy school, but if you need to eat a full meal please plan to do so before or after the event. Please be prepared to show proof of vaccination and a same-day negative covid test to attend.</p>
        <p>We will have a social on Saturday evening. More info about these socials will be shared at the singing.</p>

        <h2 class="text-pretitle">Housing</h2>
        <p>Please direct inquiries about staying with local singers to Jennifer Jones at <a href="mailto:poshhousingcommittee@gmail.com">poshhousingcommittee@gmail.com</a>, the sooner the better. There are also numerous AirBnB's within walking distance; search in the Belmont/Sunnyside, Laurelhurst, and Kerns neighborhoods. Your best hotel options are the Aloft, Holiday Inn Express, and Residence Inn at the airport (PDX), all modern hotels adjacent to MAX light rail stations that are a single easy transfer away from The Laurelhurst Club.</p>

        <h2 class="text-pretitle">COVID Protocols</h2>
        <p>The plan is to sing indoors with optional masking, and singers should be fully vaccinated including boosters. We will have windows open in the singing venue for cross-ventilation, and we will be using a CO2 monitor, which is a good proxy for ventilation efficiency. We will also be asking people to take an antigen test twice during the weekend - once on Friday evening or Saturday morning depending on whether you attend the Singing School, and again on Sunday morning. Please plan to bring two tests per attendee (all ages) if you are visiting us from afar. Please test yourself at your home/accommodation before leaving for the Singing, and snap a picture of the negative test result with your phone. We will also have some tests available at the door if you forget yours or if you have difficulty procuring tests. We will post a detailed update to these protocols in the days leading up to the Double All Day. Thank you for cooperating with this policy to keep us all safe.</p>

        <p>For more information contact Jane Cannon at <a href="mailto:poshchair@gmail.com">poshchair@gmail.com</a></p>

        <p>OK then, we hope to see y'all there!</p>
