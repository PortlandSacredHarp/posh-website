        <h2 class="text-pretitle">Singing School</h2>
        <p>There will be a Singing School on Friday night (Oct 14) from 7-9 PM taught by long-time singer and teacher Jonathan Smith. Location TBD, stay "tuned" as this promises to be very special.</p>

        <h2 class="text-pretitle">Housing</h2>
        <p>Please direct inquiries about staying with local singers to Thom at poshhousingcommittee@gmail.com, the sooner the better. There are also numerous AirBnB's within walking distance; search in the Belmont/Sunnyside, Laurelhurst, and Kerns neighborhoods. Your best hotel options are the Aloft, Holiday Inn Express, and Residence Inn at the airport (PDX), all modern hotels adjacent to MAX light rail stations that are a single easy transfer away from The Laurelhurst Club.</p>

        <h2 class="text-pretitle">Childcare</h2>
        <p>We are planning to have a supervised play area for kids in the upstairs mezzanine of the Laurelhurst Club on Saturday and Sunday! RSVPs and a willingness to be available to your children throughout the day are appreciated.</p>

        <h2 class="text-pretitle">COVID Protocols</h2>
        <p>The plan is to sing indoors with optional masking, and singers should be fully vaccinated including boosters. We will have windows open in the singing venue for cross-ventilation, and we will be using a CO2 monitor, which is a good proxy for ventilation efficiency. We will also be asking people to take an antigen test twice during the weekend - once on Friday evening or Saturday morning depending on whether you attend the Singing School, and again on Sunday morning. Please plan to bring two tests per attendee (all ages) if you are visiting us from afar. Please test yourself at your home/accommodation before leaving for the Singing, and snap a picture of the negative test result with your phone. We will also have some tests available at the door if you forget yours or if you have difficulty procuring tests. We will post a detailed update to these protocols in the days leading up to the Convention.Thank you for cooperating with this policy to keep us all safe.</p>

        <p>OK then, we hope to see y'all there!</p>
